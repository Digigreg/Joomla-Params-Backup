# Params Backup
### Instantly backup and reload Joomla! extensions settings.

This **Joomla backup plugin** allows you to **save Joomla extension settings**: modules, plugins, templates and components configurations.

How many times has it happened to modify the settings of a plugin, a module or a template and, after various tests, not being able to go back to the previous configuration?

With **Params Backup** you can **save settings of Joomla extension** you are editing, and then reload them when necessary, with one click.

The settings are saved in json format in files stored in a folder inside the **Params Backup plugin**.

This **backup plugin for Joomla** inject a new tab into the forms of modules, plugins, templates, and components configurations, accessible from the administrative area of a Joomla website.

The tab contains the three main buttons of the plugin: save, load, delete. These are used respectively to save the current settings of the extension you are working on, to load previously saved settings, to delete a previously saved and no longer needed file.
